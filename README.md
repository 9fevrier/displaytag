# displaytag

This project is a fork of the [display tag library](http://www.displaytag.org/10/tlds.html). This fork is upgrading any dependencies as iText and Apache POI.

The display tag library is an open source suite of custom tags that provide high-level web presentation patterns which will work in an MVC model. The library provides a significant amount of functionality while still being easy to use.
